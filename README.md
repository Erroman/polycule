# Welcome to polycule. A tool for creating visualizations of polyamorous relationship structures.

Relationship Tracking is Hard
-----------------------------

Kate and Dave are married. Kate also dates Jeremy, Allison, and Carl. Jeremy,
is also seeing Jane, who is also dating Dave and Carl. Dave is also dating Liz
and Jody.

The above is confusing enough to explain to those who understand polyamory.
Wouldn't it be nice though to have a visualization? What if you aggregated it
among multiple 'polycules'? Essentially what you get is a molecule like
structure.

It might look something like this:

As you can see, the visualization is very nice and clear. You know who is with
who. Plus, you can see specifics of a relationship. Fluid bonding, marriage,
FwB, etc., can be added as tags by the submitter. For now, these are limited to
being represented based upon current knowledge.

Eventually, features like latest STI check, etc, should be available in each
partner's profile. This feature will need some serious consideration for such
things as privacy, trust levels, etc. The future of this feature is not clear.
